## Developer Certificate of Origin

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) in lieu of a
Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for all contributions to this
project. DCO is a legally binding statement that asserts that you are

When you contribute to this repository with a pull request, you need
